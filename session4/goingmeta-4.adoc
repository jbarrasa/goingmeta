= Going Meta - Session 4 - Ontology-based reasoning

== Populate and explore the graph

We'll use the simplest and easiest access dataset, the movie DB. On your browser, type and click away...

[source, python]
----
:play movies
----

=== Visually explore the data in bloom?

Search for a person named Clint Eastwood that directed something... then expand
other relationships for Clint, then for the movie Unforgiven... expand the relationships
for Gene Hackman...

== Queries to surface entities: Find me all directors

The concept of a director is present in my database but it's *__implicit__*.
I can surface it with a query because...
1) I can understand English and the schema and the data in the db are in English
2) I know that a director is someone who directs a movie

Here's what a cypher expression would look like...

[source, python]
----
match (x)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)
return distinct x.name as director
----

Or we can transform the query into a script to *enrich* the graph
(regularly in batch mode or a a trigger every time new data is added):

[source, python]
----
match (x)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)
set x:Director
----

But where are the semantics in all this?

Well, the understanding of what a director is is in my brain and i've somehow
encoded it in the cypher query.

== Go Meta, make semantics explicit!
Let's try to write a generic method that would work on ANY model. Sounds exciting, right?
I'd like to give it a formal description of my data and the method, let's call it the "meta-procedure" would do the rest.


Let's try it:

First let's describe our data: We describe our data in terms of nodes and rels.
And we can agree that the meaning of from and to is as follows...

image::https://github.com/jbarrasa/goingmeta/raw/main/session4/img/onto-1.gif[]

Directors are connected to movies through 'directed' relationships. Or in other words
if something is related to something else through a 'directed' relationship then
one is a director and the other is a movie.

[source, python]
----
merge (from:_Category { name: "Director"})
merge (to:_Category { name: "Movie"})
merge (from)<-[:_from]-(r:_Relationship { name: "DIRECTED"})-[:_to]->(to)
----

that we can connect with the data in a META query...

[source, python]
----
match (from:_Category)<-[:_from]-(r:_Relationship)-[:_to]->(to:_Category)
match (x)-[rel]->(y)
where type(rel) = r.name
return x ,  " is a " + from.name, y, " is a " + to.name
----

That is interesting... because if we extend our model description with a definition of
what an actor is...

image::https://github.com/jbarrasa/goingmeta/raw/main/session4/img/onto-2.gif[]

[source, python]
----
merge (from:_Category { name: "Actor"})
merge (to:_Category { name: "Movie"})
merge (from)<-[:_from]-(r:_Relationship { name: "ACTED_IN"})-[:_to]->(to)
----

Our procedure picks up both! and applies the logic to both actors and directors
that's quite powerful!

== And let's create an micro-inferencing engine

Now we can write a generic script that reads our definitions, and enriches our graph
with some extra types.

[source, python]
----
match (from:_Category)<-[:_from]-(r:_Relationship)-[:_to]->(to:_Category)
match (x)-[rel]->(y)
where type(rel) = r.name
call apoc.create.addLabels(x,[from.name]) yield node as xs
call apoc.create.addLabels(y,[to.name]) yield node as ys
return count(xs) + count(ys) + " nodes updated"
----

You may or may not have noticed, but we've created an ontology (!!)
A formal, explicit, description of some consensuated understanding of a domain.

=== We can fully automate the inferencing step...
Let's build this into a trigger so that every time we write to the graph this
generic logic is executed:

I only need to add a fragment so that the logic is only executed on newly created
rels

[source, python]
----
rel in $createdRelationships
----

Remember that Neo4j is a transactional store and can execute this logic in the
context of a transaction so that it all works or it all fails, but does not
leave you in an inconsistent state.
__I say this as if it was nothing and it's a crucial characteristic of a DB
but I guess it's out of scope for today's session.__

[source, python]
----
CALL apoc.trigger.add('microinferencer',
'
match (from:_Category)<-[:_from]-(r:_Relationship)-[:_to]->(to:_Category)
match (x)-[rel]->(y)
where rel in $createdRelationships and type(rel) = r.name
call apoc.create.addLabels(x,[from.name]) yield node as xs
call apoc.create.addLabels(y,[to.name]) yield node as ys
return count(xs) + count(ys) + " nodes updated"

', {phase:'before'})
----

Note: In order to do that you need to enable the use of triggers by adding
`apoc.trigger.enabled=true` to your `neo4j.cof config`. I've done it already.

And finally let's test this. This should be the most fun part:

[source, python]
----
merge (alex:Person { name : "Alex Erdl"})
merge (jb:Person { name : "Jesús Barrasa"})
merge (gm:Movie { title: "Going Meta!"})
merge (alex)-[:DIRECTED]->(gm)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(jb)
----

Quick query on the data we just created...

[source, python]
----
match  path = shortestPath((:Person { name : "Alex Erdl"})-[*..2]-(:Person { name : "Jesús Barrasa"}))
return path
----

Magic!!

Note that the logic of this will entirely depend on our ontology. If there's no
ontology there will be no inference. So entirely data driven because our ontology
is explicit and part of our data, as it lives in the graph.


== Conclusions

Semantics means "meaning". Meaning can be implicit in the head of the developers or we can try to make bits of it
explicit and use it both programmatically for inference but also for describing our data
and if we get to agree with a community of users... (at the department or at
the enterprise level...) to facilitate interoperability by creating canonical models. Data contracts.


An ontology is a formal description of a domain.
It's also a graph and can live in the same database as the data.
It's described in terms of a set of primitives (categories, relationships, properties,
hierarchies... but it can have more sophisticated constructs like symmetry, transitiveness, etc)
Good idea? Up to you to decide.

We like hierarchies for recommendation, for semantic similarity. We see clear value out of them
but beyond that... you'll have to figure out if the value is worth the effort.

*Inference* is deriving new information based on the explicit semantics of the ontology.
Inferencing engines work on data and metadata (ontology and instance data...) and do
different kinds of things. Today we got a hint at inferencing...
But think of model validation: SHACL (watch previous GoingMeta session).


== Q&A

*Question:* __I've created my onto in OWL, can I use it?__
Yes! Actually, let's do it.

[source, turtle]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT n10s_unique_uri FOR (r:Resource) REQUIRE r.uri IS UNIQUE;


call n10s.graphconfig.init({ handleVocabUris: "IGNORE",
classLabel: "_Category", objectPropertyLabel: "_Relationship",
domainRel : "_from", rangeRel: "_to" , force: true});
----

[source, turtle]
----
call n10s.onto.preview.inline('

@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

','Turtle')

Let's test this too:

[source, python]
----
merge (mh:Person { name : "Michael Hunger"})
merge (gm:Movie { title: "Going Meta!"})
merge (mh)-[:REVIEWED]->(gm)
----

*Question:* __My ontology is quite dynamic and I don't want to materialise with a trigger the result of an inference.
I want it computed on the fly__

We got you covered :) In the session I've used the simplest approach for this introductory session but in many cases that's what we want to do.
Look at the procedures in n10s for taxonomies of properties and relationships

[source, python]
----
// Give me all Artists:
call n10s.inference.nodesLabelled("Artist")
----

check that none has the Artist label explicitly


[source, python]
----
// and we can be more precise:
call n10s.inference.nodesLabelled("Artist") yield node
where node:Actor
return count(node)
----
